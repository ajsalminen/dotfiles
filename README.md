Dotfiles
=========

My dotfile configuration. Uses ["fresh"](http://github.com/freshshell/fresh)
which can be used to install even single files from git repositories and to
merge bits of config from multiple files into one to avoid slow startup time
with zsh for example.

Some of the things I use
--------------

* Emacs
* Zsh
* Debian GNU/Linux


License
-------

Many things here are based on the work of other people so it's likely that I
cannot grant a license for everything included here. I have tried to give a
source for everything that I've used but it's entirely possible that I've missed
a few. For the parts that are my own, you can basically do anything you like
with them, they are dual-licensed under the MIT/Simplified BSD license.
